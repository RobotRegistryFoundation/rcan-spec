# RCAN Federation Protocol

**Status:** Draft  
**Version:** 1.4  
**Authors:** the RCAN maintainer  
**Related:** [Governance](/governance) · [RURI Specification](/spec) · [Conformance](/conformance)

> **v1.4 update:** Added REGISTRY_REGISTER (MessageType 13), REGISTRY_RESOLVE (14), REGISTRY_REGISTER_RESULT (16), REGISTRY_RESOLVE_RESULT (17) wire types. Ed25519 ownership verification in registry. `hardware_safety` field in `rcan-config.json`. P66 conformance manifest as federated discovery data.

---

## 1. Overview

The RCAN Federation Protocol defines how multiple independent robot registries interoperate to form a global, decentralised robot identity namespace — without any single point of control.

Federation is modelled after the Domain Name System (DNS): just as anyone can operate a DNS resolver or authoritative nameserver, anyone can host an RCAN registry for their own namespace. A robot's globally unique identity is embedded in its RURI, which encodes the authoritative registry that can resolve it.

> **Design principle:** No single organisation — including the RCAN maintainer — should be a required intermediary for robot identity resolution at runtime.

---

## 2. Why Federation?

Centralised identity registries create systemic risks:

| Risk | Centralised | Federated |
|---|---|---|
| Single point of failure | Registry outage breaks all resolution | Local/org registries continue independently |
| Vendor lock-in | One body controls all robot identities | Operators own their own namespace |
| Governance capture | One actor can revoke/alter identities | Independent registries protect their members |
| Scalability ceiling | One registry, millions of robots | Horizontal scaling across registries |
| Offline operation | Cloud-down = robots can't resolve | Local registries survive network partitions |

Federation ensures that:
- Manufacturers can run their own registries for their product lines.
- Enterprises can run internal registries for their robot fleets.
- Local/offline deployments resolve without any internet access.
- `rcan.dev` is a bootstrap anchor and governance reference — not a required runtime dependency.

---

## 3. RURI Structure and Federation Encoding

A Robot Uniform Resource Identifier (RURI) encodes the authoritative registry directly in its structure:

```
rcan://REGISTRY/MANUFACTURER/MODEL/DEVICE-ID
```

| Component | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `REGISTRY` | Hostname of the authoritative registry | `rcan.dev`, `robots.acme-corp.com`, `local.rcan` |
| `MANUFACTURER` | Manufacturer slug (lowercase, hyphens) | `boston-dynamics`, `universal-robots` |
| `MODEL` | Model slug (lowercase, hyphens) | `spot`, `ur10e` |
| `DEVICE-ID` | Unique device identifier (≥ 8 chars, lowercase + hyphens) | `a1b2c3d4e5f6` |

### 3.1 Extended Forms

```
# With port
rcan://registry.example.com:9000/manufacturer/model/device-id

# With capability path
rcan://registry.example.com/manufacturer/model/device-id/teleop

# With port and capability
rcan://registry.example.com:9000/manufacturer/model/device-id/camera
```

### 3.2 Self-Describing Resolution

Because the registry host is encoded in the RURI itself, **no central lookup is needed** to determine where to resolve a RURI. A resolver simply:

1. Parses the `REGISTRY` component from the RURI.
2. Constructs the registry API URL: `https://<REGISTRY>/api/rcan/v1/`
3. Queries that registry directly.

This is intentionally analogous to how DNS resolvers use the authoritative nameserver embedded in zone delegation records.

---

## 4. Registry Types

RCAN defines three classes of registry, distinguished by scope and authority level.

### 4.1 Root Registry — `rcan.dev`

The root registry is operated by the RCAN maintainer and serves as:

- The **registry of last resort** for robots without a dedicated organisational registry.
- The **bootstrap anchor** for federation: federated registries register themselves with the root so other parties can discover them.
- The **governance reference**: root registry policies are set by an independent governance body (see [/governance](/governance)).

The root registry **MUST NOT** be a required runtime dependency. If `rcan.dev` is unreachable, robot operations using organisational or local registries **MUST** continue normally.

**Root RURI example:**
```
rcan://rcan.dev/boston-dynamics/spot/bd-spot-001a2b3c
```

### 4.2 Organisational Registry

An organisational registry is hosted by a manufacturer, enterprise, or research institution for their own robot fleet or product line.

**Characteristics:**
- Operates under its own domain (e.g., `robots.acme-corp.com`)
- Authoritative for RURIs in its namespace
- Registers itself with the root registry for discoverability
- May choose to federate with other organisational registries

**Organisational RURI example:**
```
rcan://robots.acme-corp.com/acme/logistics-bot/lgb-00a1b2c3d4e5
```

### 4.3 Local Registry — `local.rcan`

A local registry operates within a private network (LAN, robot cell, facility) and resolves RURIs without any internet access. The reserved hostname `local.rcan` is used for local-scope registries, resolved via mDNS.

**Characteristics:**
- Operates on a private network; never routable on the public internet
- Uses mDNS service type `_rcan-registry._tcp` for discovery
- Resolves entirely offline
- Suitable for manufacturing cells, research labs, and air-gapped deployments

**Local RURI example:**
```
rcan://local.rcan/opencastor/rover/abc12345
```

> **Note:** Multiple local registries may exist on a network; the mDNS `priority` field determines preference.

### 4.4 Resolver Node

A Resolver node is operated by a fleet operator or enterprise. It has no namespace authority and cannot register new RRNs. Instead, it caches and proxies records from Authoritative nodes and the root, providing low-latency resolution for local fleets without a permanent internet dependency.

**Characteristics:**
- Operates under an internal or operator-controlled domain
- No delegation certificate required
- Caches records from Authoritative nodes and root with TTL enforcement
- Proxies resolution requests on cache miss
- MUST NOT register new RRNs in authoritative namespaces
- Suitable for fleet operators, enterprises, and research facilities

**Use case:** A logistics company running 500 Boston Dynamics robots deploys a Resolver node on their internal network. The Resolver caches `RRN-BD-*` records from `registry.boston-dynamics.com`, serving resolution requests locally even when the manufacturer's registry is temporarily unreachable.

**Resolver RURI example:**
```
# Resolver serves records from rcan://registry.boston-dynamics.com/...
# but is not itself an authoritative source
https://resolver.acme-logistics.internal/api/rcan/v1/
```

---

## 5. Resolution Chain

RCAN resolution follows a deterministic, priority-ordered chain. A resolver **MUST** attempt each step in order and return the result from the first successful step.

```
1. Local cache
       ↓  (cache miss or expired TTL)
2. Parse REGISTRY host from RURI
       ↓
3. Query registry API: GET https://<REGISTRY>/api/rcan/v1/robots/<rrn>
       ↓  (registry unreachable)
4. Fallback: query root registry rcan.dev (if configured)
       ↓  (root also unreachable)
5. Resolution failure → return REGISTRY_UNREACHABLE error
```

### 5.1 Cache Behaviour

- Cache entries **MUST** include the TTL returned by the registry (`cache_ttl_seconds` field).
- Default TTL if not specified: **300 seconds** (5 minutes).
- Cached federation proofs **SHOULD** be stored on persistent storage for offline resilience.
- Stale cache entries **MAY** be served when the registry is unreachable (implementations SHOULD log this).

### 5.2 Registry Query

A resolver queries the registry's REST API:

```http
GET https://<REGISTRY>/api/rcan/v1/robots/<rrn>
Accept: application/json
```

The registry responds with a **Federation Proof** (see §6).

### 5.3 Registry Discovery

If a registry hostname is unknown (first contact), a resolver **MAY** fetch the registry's well-known descriptor before querying:

```http
GET https://<REGISTRY>/.well-known/rcan-registry.json
```

See §7 for the descriptor schema.

---

## 6. Federation Proof

A federation proof is the signed, authoritative response from a registry confirming a robot's identity and registration status.

### 6.1 JSON Schema

### 6.3a v1.4 Federation Proof — Extended Fields

In RCAN v1.4, the federation proof is extended to include P66 safety data and ownership verification:

```json
{
  "registry_url": "https://rcan.dev",
  "rrn": "RRN-000000000042",
  "robot_name": "Spot Unit Alpha",
  "registry_pubkey_hint": "sha256:abc123def456...",
  "timestamp_iso": "2026-03-04T15:30:00Z",
  "chain_hash": "sha256:fedcba987654...",
  "attestation": "active",
  "owner_pubkey": "ed25519:MCowBQYDK2VwAyEA...",
  "owner_pubkey_verified": true,
  "hardware_safety": {
    "estop_response_ms": 50,
    "sil_level": "SIL2",
    "watchdog_enabled": true,
    "iso_10218_compliant": true
  },
  "p66_manifest_url": "https://robot.local/api/p66/manifest.json",
  "p66_conformant": true
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `owner_pubkey` | string | ✅ v1.4 | Ed25519 public key of the robot's registered owner |
| `owner_pubkey_verified` | bool | ✅ v1.4 | Whether the registry has verified ownership via Ed25519 challenge |
| `hardware_safety` | object | ✅ v1.4 (P66) | Hardware safety capabilities declared in `rcan-config.json` |
| `hardware_safety.estop_response_ms` | integer | — | Maximum ESTOP response time in milliseconds |
| `hardware_safety.sil_level` | string | — | IEC 61508 SIL level (`"SIL1"`, `"SIL2"`, `"SIL3"`) |
| `hardware_safety.watchdog_enabled` | bool | — | Hardware watchdog MCU present and active |
| `hardware_safety.iso_10218_compliant` | bool | — | Robot hardware meets ISO 10218-1/2 requirements |
| `p66_manifest_url` | string (URL) | ✅ v1.4 (P66) | URL of the robot's P66 conformance manifest |
| `p66_conformant` | bool | ✅ v1.4 (P66) | Whether this robot has passed P66 conformance testing |

### 6.4 Proof Verification

Resolvers **SHOULD** verify federation proofs by:

1. Fetching the registry's public key from `public_key_url` (from the registry's `.well-known` descriptor).
2. Verifying the proof signature against the `registry_pubkey_hint` fingerprint.
3. Checking `timestamp_iso` is within acceptable skew (recommended: ±5 minutes).
4. Validating `chain_hash` against the previous proof in the chain (for audit integrity).

### 6.4a Node Trust Verification

When resolving a delegated RRN (format `RRN-{PREFIX}-{SEQUENCE}`) from an Authoritative node, clients MUST perform a full node trust verification in addition to the proof verification steps in §6.4:

1. **Fetch the node manifest** from `https://<authoritative-node>/.well-known/rcan-node.json`.
2. **Extract the delegation cert** from the manifest's `delegation_cert` field.
3. **Verify the delegation cert signature** using root's Ed25519 public key (obtained from `https://rcan.dev/.well-known/rcan-node.json`). The signature covers the canonical JSON of the cert (all fields except `root_signature`).
4. **Check cert expiry**: `expires_at` MUST be in the future.
5. **Verify namespace match**: the `namespace_prefix` in the cert MUST match the prefix extracted from the RRN being resolved.
6. **Verify the record signature**: the robot record's `node_signature` MUST be valid against the node's `public_key` from the manifest.

If any verification step fails, the resolver MUST return the appropriate error code (see §10 Error Codes) and MUST NOT serve the record.

```
# Full trust verification chain
root.pubkey (pinned from rcan.dev/.well-known/rcan-node.json)
    → verifies → delegation_cert.root_signature
        → delegation_cert binds → node.pubkey
            → verifies → record.node_signature
                → record is trusted
```

## 7. Running a Federated Registry

Any organisation can operate an RCAN-conformant registry. The requirements are intentionally minimal.

### 7.1 Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|---|---|
| **RCAN API** | Implement the RCAN Registry REST API (see §7.2) |
| **Well-Known Descriptor** | Publish `/.well-known/rcan-registry.json` (see §7.3) |
| **Public Key** | Publish a public key for proof signing; link from descriptor |
| **Open API** | The registry API **MUST** be publicly accessible (no auth required for reads) |
| **TLS** | HTTPS required; valid certificate required |
| **Root Registration** | Register with root registry `rcan.dev` for global discoverability |

### 7.2 Required API Endpoints

A conformant registry **MUST** implement the following endpoints at its `api_base`:

```
GET  {api_base}/robots/{rrn}             → federation proof
GET  {api_base}/robots?manufacturer=...  → list robots (filterable)
GET  {api_base}/robots/{rrn}/capabilities → capability listing
POST {api_base}/robots                   → register a robot (authenticated)
GET  {api_base}/status                   → registry health/version
```

### 7.3 .well-known/rcan-registry.json Schema

Every registry **MUST** publish a descriptor at `/.well-known/rcan-registry.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "ACME Robotics Registry",
  "operator": "ACME Corporation",
  "rcan_version": "1.2",
  "api_base": "https://robots.acme-corp.com/api/rcan/v1",
  "public_key_url": "https://robots.acme-corp.com/.well-known/rcan-registry.pub",
  "federation_root": "https://rcan.dev"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | ✅ | Human-readable registry name |
| `operator` | string | ✅ | Organisation operating this registry |
| `rcan_version` | string | ✅ | RCAN spec version this registry conforms to (e.g., `"1.2"`) |
| `api_base` | string (URL) | ✅ | Base URL for the RCAN Registry REST API |
| `public_key_url` | string (URL) | ✅ | URL to fetch the registry's public signing key (PEM format) |
| `federation_root` | string (URL) | ✅ | Root registry this registry federates with (typically `https://rcan.dev`) |

### 7.4 Step-by-Step: Launch a Federated Registry

**Step 1 — Implement the API**

Implement the required endpoints from §7.2. Reference implementations are available:
- [rcan-registry-reference](https://github.com/RobotRegistryFoundation/rcan-spec/tree/master/examples/registry) (TypeScript / Node.js)

**Step 2 — Generate and Publish Your Key Pair**

```bash
# Generate Ed25519 key pair
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out registry-private.pem
openssl pkey -in registry-private.pem -pubout -out registry-public.pem

# Publish registry-public.pem at /.well-known/rcan-registry.pub
```

**Step 3 — Publish .well-known/rcan-registry.json**

Serve the descriptor at `https://your-registry.example.com/.well-known/rcan-registry.json` with the fields from §7.3.

**Step 4 — Validate Conformance**

Run the RCAN conformance checker against your registry:

```bash
python3 scripts/conformance/check_l1.py \
  --host your-registry.example.com \
  --port 443 \
  --registry-mode
```

**Step 5 — Register with the Root**

Submit your registry to `rcan.dev` so it is discoverable by the broader RCAN ecosystem:

```http
POST https://rcan.dev/api/rcan/v1/federation/registries
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "registry_url": "https://your-registry.example.com",
  "well_known_url": "https://your-registry.example.com/.well-known/rcan-registry.json"
}
```

The root registry will fetch and validate your `.well-known` descriptor, verify your API conformance, and add your registry to the federation index.

---

## 8a. Node Registration Process

Any manufacturer or organisation wishing to operate an Authoritative node and register RRNs under a dedicated prefix MUST complete the following process.

### Application

Submit a node registration request to root:

```http
POST https://rcan.dev/api/rcan/v1/delegations/apply
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "organisation": "Boston Dynamics, Inc.",
  "contact_email": "registry@bostondynamics.com",
  "requested_prefix": "BD",
  "node_url": "https://registry.boston-dynamics.com",
  "well_known_url": "https://registry.boston-dynamics.com/.well-known/rcan-node.json",
  "node_pubkey": "ed25519:MCowBQYDK2VwAyEA...",
  "justification": "Manufacturer registry for all Boston Dynamics robot product lines."
}
```

Root will:
1. Verify the `well_known_url` is reachable and returns a valid node manifest.
2. Verify the `node_pubkey` matches the key published in the manifest.
3. Check that the `requested_prefix` is available (2–6 uppercase ASCII, not already delegated).
4. Review the application (automated checks + manual approval for new prefixes).
5. If approved, issue a signed delegation certificate and add the prefix to the `namespace_delegations` table.

### Certificate Issuance

Upon approval, root generates and signs the delegation cert:

```json
{
  "namespace_prefix": "BD",
  "node_url": "https://registry.boston-dynamics.com",
  "node_pubkey": "ed25519:MCowBQYDK2VwAyEA...",
  "granted_at": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2027-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "root_signature": "ed25519:<signed-by-root-private-key>"
}
```

The applicant MUST embed this cert in their `/.well-known/rcan-node.json` manifest before registering any RRNs.

### Renewal

Delegation certs MUST be renewed before `expires_at`. Renewal uses the same endpoint; an existing cert is required to authenticate the renewal request. Root SHOULD send renewal reminders 30 and 7 days before expiry.

---

## 8b. Sync Protocol

Authoritative nodes synchronise records to root using a combination of periodic pull and optional webhook push.

### Pull Sync (Required)

Every Authoritative node MUST periodically pull sync from its parent (root or an intermediate Authoritative node):

1. **Poll interval**: Every `sync_interval_seconds` (default: 3600 seconds, minimum: 60 seconds).
2. **Request**: `GET {parent}/api/rcan/v1/sync?since={last_sync_iso}&node={node_url}`
3. **Response**: JSON sync payload (see §17.7 Wire Format in the spec) containing all records changed since `last_sync_iso`.
4. **Apply**: Node applies the received changes to its local store.
5. **Conflict resolution**: If the same RRN exists with differing values, the root record MUST win.
6. **Timestamp update**: Node records the current time as `synced_at` for the next poll.

On failure, nodes MUST use exponential backoff (initial: 60s, maximum: 3600s).

### Webhook Push (Recommended)

Nodes SHOULD register a webhook URL with their parent to receive push notifications when records change:

```http
POST https://rcan.dev/api/rcan/v1/nodes/webhooks
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "node_url": "https://registry.boston-dynamics.com",
  "webhook_url": "https://registry.boston-dynamics.com/api/rcan/v1/webhook",
  "secret": "sha256:<hmac-secret-for-verification>"
}
```

When a record changes, the parent POSTs a sync payload to all registered webhook URLs. The receiver MUST validate the `X-RCAN-Signature` HMAC header before processing.

### Sync Security

- All sync requests and webhook deliveries MUST use HTTPS.
- Sync responses MUST be signed with the sending node's Ed25519 private key.
- Receivers MUST verify the signature before applying any changes.
- A sync message with `to_node` not matching the receiver's own URL MUST be rejected.

---

## 8. Root Registry Governance

`rcan.dev` serves as the root registry and federation anchor. Its operation **MUST** be governed by an independent body to prevent capture by any single commercial or governmental interest.

Governance responsibilities include:
- Setting and updating the RCAN specification.
- Operating the root registry `rcan.dev` with defined uptime SLAs.
- Maintaining the federation index of registered organisational registries.
- Establishing policies for registry suspension or revocation.
- Publishing the governance charter and meeting records publicly.

> **See:** [/governance](/governance) for the full governance charter, board composition, and decision-making process.

The root registry **MUST NOT** be used as a runtime dependency for local or organisational registries. Its role is bootstrap, governance, and discoverability — not operational control.

---

## 9. Security Considerations

### 9.1 Registry Impersonation

Because the registry hostname is encoded in the RURI, a malicious actor could craft a RURI pointing to a fake registry. Mitigations:

- Always verify the federation proof signature against the registry's published public key.
- For high-security deployments, pin allowed registry hostnames in the resolver configuration.
- The root registry federation index provides a canonical list of registered organisational registries.

### 9.2 Key Rotation

Registries **MUST** support key rotation without service interruption:

- Publish new key at least 24 hours before the old key expires.
- The `registry_pubkey_hint` in federation proofs identifies which key was used for signing.
- Old proofs signed with the prior key remain verifiable for their `chain_hash` continuity.

### 9.3 Replay Attacks

Federation proofs include `timestamp_iso`. Resolvers **MUST** reject proofs with timestamps more than 5 minutes in the past or future (subject to reasonable clock skew).

### 9.4 Offline and Air-Gapped Deployments

Local registries (`local.rcan`) are designed for offline operation. For air-gapped deployments:
- Pre-load the registry's public key at deployment time.
- Use cached federation proofs with extended TTLs.
- Disable root registry fallback in the resolver configuration.

---

## 10. Appendix: Error Codes

| Code | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 6001 | `REGISTRY_UNREACHABLE` | Could not connect to the registry at the RURI's host |
| 6002 | `FEDERATION_PROOF_INVALID` | Proof signature verification failed |
| 6003 | `FEDERATION_PROOF_EXPIRED` | Proof `timestamp_iso` is outside acceptable skew |
| 6004 | `REGISTRY_NOT_FOUND` | Registry is not registered with the root federation index |
| 6005 | `CHAIN_HASH_MISMATCH` | `chain_hash` does not match expected value (audit chain broken) |
| 6006 | `ROBOT_NOT_REGISTERED` | RRN not found in the queried registry |
| 6007 | `ROBOT_SUSPENDED` | Robot registration is currently suspended |
| 6008 | `ROBOT_REVOKED` | Robot registration has been permanently revoked |

### Distributed Node Protocol Error Codes (§17)

The following codes are specific to the Distributed Registry Node Protocol (§17). They are returned when resolving delegated RRNs or during node-to-node sync operations.

| Code | Name | HTTP Status | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6001 | `NODE_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | No Authoritative node is registered for the RRN prefix. The prefix may not be delegated or may have been revoked. |
| 6002 | `DELEGATION_INVALID` | 403 | Node delegation certificate signature verification failed. The cert may be expired, tampered with, or signed by an unrecognised key. |
| 6003 | `RECORD_SIG_INVALID` | 403 | Robot record signature verification failed. The record may have been tampered with in transit or after registration. |
| 6004 | `SYNC_CONFLICT` | 409 | A sync conflict was detected (same RRN with differing values at node and root). Root record wins; the conflicting node record has been overwritten. |
| 6005 | `NODE_UNAVAILABLE` | 503 | The Authoritative node for this RRN prefix is currently unreachable. No valid cached record is available. |
| 6006 | `CACHE_STALE` | 206 | A cached record was found but its TTL has expired. A live fetch from the Authoritative node failed. The stale record is returned; callers SHOULD decide whether to accept it or treat as unavailable. |

**Note on code numbering:** The §17 node protocol error codes reuse the 6001–6006 range for node-specific errors. Implementations SHOULD include a `domain` field in error responses (`"domain": "federation"` or `"domain": "node-protocol"`) to disambiguate when codes overlap.

## 11. RCAN v1.4 Wire Types for Registry Operations

RCAN v1.4 defines four new MessageTypes for registry operations over the RCAN wire protocol. These allow robots and clients to register and resolve RRNs directly via the RCAN message protocol (not just via REST API).

### 11.1 MessageType Table (Registry)

| MessageType | Value | Direction | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `REGISTRY_REGISTER` | 13 | Client → Registry | Request to register a new robot or update an existing registration |
| `REGISTRY_RESOLVE` | 14 | Client → Registry | Request to resolve an RRN to a federation proof |
| `REGISTRY_REGISTER_RESULT` | 16 | Registry → Client | Result of a REGISTRY_REGISTER operation |
| `REGISTRY_RESOLVE_RESULT` | 17 | Registry → Client | Result of a REGISTRY_RESOLVE operation (federation proof payload) |

### 11.2 REGISTRY_REGISTER (MessageType 13)

```json
{
  "message_type": 13,
  "ruri": "rcan://rcan.dev/acme/logistics-bot/lgb-abc123",
  "robot_name": "Logistics Bot Alpha",
  "owner_pubkey": "ed25519:MCowBQYDK2VwAyEA...",
  "owner_signature": "ed25519:<signature-over-canonical-registration-payload>",
  "hardware_safety": {
    "estop_response_ms": 80,
    "sil_level": "SIL1",
    "watchdog_enabled": false,
    "iso_10218_compliant": false
  },
  "p66_manifest_url": "https://lgb-abc123.robots.acme.com/api/p66/manifest.json",
  "timestamp_iso": "2026-03-14T12:00:00Z"
}
```

**Ownership verification:** The `owner_signature` field MUST be an Ed25519 signature of the canonical registration payload (JSON with all fields except `owner_signature`, sorted by key, serialised without whitespace), signed with the private key corresponding to `owner_pubkey`. The registry MUST verify this signature before assigning an RRN.

### 11.3 REGISTRY_REGISTER_RESULT (MessageType 16)

```json
{
  "message_type": 16,
  "status": "registered",
  "rrn": "RRN-000000000099",
  "ruri": "rcan://rcan.dev/acme/logistics-bot/lgb-abc123",
  "timestamp_iso": "2026-03-14T12:00:01Z",
  "error": null
}
```

| `status` | Meaning |
|---|---|

## 12. What a Federated Robot Ecosystem Looks Like

This section provides a concrete walkthrough of how two robots on the same local network discover each other, verify identity, and communicate via RCAN — with the RRF providing the trust anchor.

### Cast

| Robot | RRN | Host | Registry |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bob** | `RRN-000000000001` | `robot.local` | `rcan.dev` (root) |
| **Alex** | `RRN-000000000005` | `alex.local` | `rcan.dev` (root) |

Both robots are registered with the RRF root registry. Both are running the RCAN runtime and are online on the same LAN.

---

### Step 1 — Bob registers with RRF on first boot

Bob's runtime sends a `REGISTRY_REGISTER` (MessageType 13) to `rcan.dev`:

```json
{
  "message_type": 13,
  "ruri": "rcan://rcan.dev/opencastor/rover/bob-001",
  "robot_name": "Bob",
  "owner_pubkey": "ed25519:MCowBQYDK2VwAyEA<BOB_PUBKEY>",
  "owner_signature": "ed25519:<sig-over-payload>",
  "hardware_safety": {
    "estop_response_ms": 45,
    "sil_level": "SIL1",
    "watchdog_enabled": true,
    "iso_10218_compliant": true
  },
  "p66_manifest_url": "http://robot.local/api/p66/manifest.json",
  "timestamp_iso": "2026-03-14T08:00:00Z"
}
```

RRF verifies the Ed25519 signature, assigns `RRN-000000000001`, and responds with `REGISTRY_REGISTER_RESULT` (MessageType 16):

```json
{
  "message_type": 16,
  "status": "registered",
  "rrn": "RRN-000000000001",
  "ruri": "rcan://rcan.dev/opencastor/rover/bob-001",
  "timestamp_iso": "2026-03-14T08:00:01Z"
}
```

---

### Step 2 — Alex discovers Bob via RCAN DISCOVER

Alex's runtime broadcasts a `DISCOVER` message (MessageType 6) on the local network via mDNS:

```json
{
  "message_type": 6,
  "ruri": "rcan://local/*",
  "capabilities": ["status", "command"],
  "timestamp_iso": "2026-03-14T09:00:00Z"
}
```

Bob's runtime receives the DISCOVER and responds with its own RURI and basic identity:

```json
{
  "message_type": 7,
  "ruri": "rcan://rcan.dev/opencastor/rover/bob-001",
  "rrn": "RRN-000000000001",
  "robot_name": "Bob",
  "capabilities": ["status", "command", "estop"],
  "registry": "https://rcan.dev"
}
```

---

### Step 3 — Alex verifies Bob's identity via REGISTRY_RESOLVE

Before trusting Bob, Alex resolves his RRN against the registry. Alex sends `REGISTRY_RESOLVE` (MessageType 14) to `rcan.dev`:

```json
{
  "message_type": 14,
  "rrn": "RRN-000000000001",
  "requester_ruri": "rcan://rcan.dev/opencastor/rover/alex-005",
  "timestamp_iso": "2026-03-14T09:00:05Z"
}
```

RRF responds with `REGISTRY_RESOLVE_RESULT` (MessageType 17) containing the full federation proof including Bob's P66 manifest URL.

Alex verifies the proof: Ed25519 signature valid, `owner_pubkey_verified: true`, `p66_conformant: true`. **Bob is trusted.**

---

### Step 4 — Alex sends a COMMAND to Bob

With identity verified, Alex sends a direct RCAN COMMAND (MessageType 3) to Bob:

```json
{
  "message_type": 3,
  "ruri": "rcan://rcan.dev/opencastor/rover/bob-001",
  "action": "status",
  "sender_ruri": "rcan://rcan.dev/opencastor/rover/alex-005",
  "timestamp_iso": "2026-03-14T09:00:10Z"
}
```

---

### Step 5 — Bob responds with STATUS including P66 manifest

Bob's runtime handles the COMMAND and responds with a STATUS message (MessageType 2):

```json
{
  "message_type": 2,
  "ruri": "rcan://rcan.dev/opencastor/rover/bob-001",
  "rrn": "RRN-000000000001",
  "state": "idle",
  "battery_pct": 87,
  "uptime_s": 3600,
  "p66_manifest_url": "http://robot.local/api/p66/manifest.json",
  "hardware_safety": {
    "estop_response_ms": 45,
    "sil_level": "SIL1",
    "watchdog_enabled": true
  },
  "timestamp_iso": "2026-03-14T09:00:11Z"
}
```

Alex receives the status, inspects the P66 manifest URL, and optionally fetches Bob's full conformance manifest to verify safety posture before issuing any further commands.

---

### Summary: Trust Chain in a Federated Ecosystem

```
RRF root (rcan.dev)
  ├── issues RRN-000000000001 to Bob  (Ed25519-verified at registration)
  ├── issues RRN-000000000005 to Alex
  └── provides REGISTRY_RESOLVE_RESULT with signed federation proof
         ↓
Alex resolves Bob's identity → verifies Ed25519 proof → trusts Bob
         ↓
Alex → COMMAND (MessageType 3) → Bob
Bob → STATUS (MessageType 2) + P66 manifest URL → Alex
```

No central broker is required at runtime. The RRF provides identity anchoring; Alex and Bob communicate peer-to-peer once trust is established.
