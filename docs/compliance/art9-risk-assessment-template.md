# Article 9 — Risk Assessment Template for RCAN-Based Robots

**Regulation:** EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689), Article 9  
**Aligned standard:** ISO 12100:2010 (Safety of Machinery — Risk Assessment)  
**RCAN spec version:** 3.2  
**Document type:** Risk assessment template  
**Status:** Normative guidance  
**Applies from:** 2 August 2026  

---

## Purpose

Article 9 requires providers of high-risk AI systems to establish, implement, document, and maintain a risk management system covering the full lifecycle. This template provides an ISO 12100-aligned structure with RCAN-specific controls mapped to each risk element.

**Complete one instance of this template per robot model/deployment configuration.**

**Probability scale:** 1=Remote, 2=Unlikely, 3=Possible, 4=Likely, 5=Near-certain  
**Risk threshold:** Score ≥12 = unacceptable; 6–11 = ALARP required; ≤5 = acceptable

- `safety.emergency_stop_configured` ✅
- `safety.watchdog_configured` ✅
- `safety.confidence_gates_configured` ✅
- `rcan_v15.estop_qos_bypass` ✅
