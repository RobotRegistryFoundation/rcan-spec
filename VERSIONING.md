# RCAN Spec Versioning Policy

## Version Format

RCAN spec versions follow `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

| Component | Meaning | Example trigger |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| **MAJOR** | Breaking wire-format or semantic changes | Removing a message type, changing role level numbers, restructuring RURI format |
| **MINOR** | Additive, backwards-compatible changes | New optional message fields, new conformance level, new §16 sub-provision |
| **PATCH** | Clarifications, editorial fixes, no behaviour change | Fixing ambiguous prose, correcting a table, adding examples |

Current version: **v3.2.0** (canonical per `spec/decisions/2026-05-04-profile-freeze.md`; v3.3.0 proposed, see CHANGELOG). The live SDK pairing is at [rcan.dev/compatibility](https://rcan.dev/compatibility).

## Backwards Compatibility Guarantee

**Within a MAJOR version:** A v1.x implementation MUST be able to communicate with any other v1.y implementation.

Specifically:
- A v1.2 sender MUST produce messages that a v1.0 receiver can parse without error (it may ignore unknown optional fields)
- A v1.0 sender MUST produce messages that a v1.2 receiver accepts (it will apply defaults for new optional fields)
- New required fields are never added in MINOR versions — only in MAJOR

**Across MAJOR versions:** No compatibility guarantee. A v2.x implementation SHOULD be able to negotiate down to v1.x via the existing `rcan_version` field in manifests.

## Stability Tiers

| Tier | Guarantee | Current provisions |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Stable** | No breaking changes without a MAJOR version bump; minimum 12 months deprecation notice | §1–§6 (RURI, RBAC, safety invariants, messaging, audit), §16 AI accountability |
| **Experimental** | May change in MINOR versions with 1 release notice | Federation protocol (v1.2), registry API format |
| **Deprecated** | Scheduled for removal; migration guide published | *(none currently)* |

## Deprecation Process

1. A provision is marked `[DEPRECATED as of vX.Y]` in the spec text
2. A migration guide is published in `docs/migration/`
3. The provision remains **Stable** (no breaking change) for a minimum of **2 minor versions** or **12 months**, whichever is longer
4. Removal only occurs in a MAJOR version bump

## Deprecation Precedents

This section records how previous flat→structured field replacements or
optional-to-required migrations were handled, so future planners can
apply the same pattern.

### v3.2 — `agent.provider` / `agent.model` → `agent.runtimes[]`

- **Shape before (v1.2 through v3.1):** flat `agent.provider`, `agent.model`, etc. in the `agent:` block.
- **Shape after (v3.2):** optional `agent.runtimes[]` array carries per-runtime harness + model config.
- **Handling:** additive MINOR bump. Flat form remains VALID in v3.2; validators SHOULD emit `DeprecationWarning` and SHOULD normalize internally to a single-entry `runtimes[]`. Removal scheduled for v4.0.
- **Rationale:** multi-runtime declaration enables peer-runtime deployments (robot-md ↔ opencastor) against a single ROBOT.md identity — see spec §8.6 and `opencastor-ops/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-23-peer-runtimes.md`.

### v3.1 — §26 EU Register `rmn` addition

- **Shape before (v3.0):** `rcan-eu-register-v1` envelope had no top-level `rmn`; Art. 49 registration was per-robot (`system.rrn`).
- **Shape after (v3.1):** top-level `rmn` required for per-model routing; `system.rrn` remains for per-submission provenance only.
- **Handling:** breaking MINOR invoked the Experimental-tier escape hatch: §26 was introduced in v3.0 just 13 days prior, had zero production consumers at bump time (all ecosystem libraries listed but no production code path used it). Breaking change permitted in MINOR with release notice.
- **Rationale:** per-model scoping is semantically required by EU AI Act Art. 49 (registration is of a system, not of each deployed robot). Discovered via robotregistryfoundation.org D3 planning.

### Pattern summary

When adding a new optional field that replaces a legacy flat pattern:
1. Ship the new field as optional in MINOR.
2. Validators emit `DeprecationWarning` on the legacy shape; normalize internally.
3. Remove the legacy shape in the next MAJOR.

When adding a required field to an Experimental-tier §N with zero production consumers:
1. Breaking MINOR is permitted per the Experimental-tier escape hatch.
2. Cascade: update all ecosystem SDKs (rcan-py, rcan-ts, downstream clients) in the same release window.
3. Call out the escape-hatch invocation explicitly in the changelog entry so the precedent is traceable.

## Long-Term Support (LTS)

Every MAJOR version is supported with security fixes for a minimum of **3 years** from its initial release date.

| Version | Release | LTS Until | Status |
|---------|---------|-----------|--------|
| v1.x | 2026-01 | 2029-01 | ✅ Active LTS (current: v1.3) |

## What Changes Between Versions

### What will never change without a MAJOR bump
- Message type integer values (COMMAND=1, CONFIG=2, etc.)
- Role level numbers (GUEST=1 through CREATOR=5)
- RURI format (`rcan://registry/manufacturer/model/device-id`)
- Safety invariant semantics (local safety wins, graceful degradation, mandatory audit)
- §16.1 model identity fields in audit records
- Commitment chain HMAC structure

### What may change in MINOR versions (additive only)
- New optional message fields
- New message types (new integer values; old values never reused)
- New conformance test cases
- New optional RCAN YAML fields
- New robot profiles
- Federation protocol refinements (Experimental tier)

### What may change in PATCH versions
- Spec prose clarifications
- Example corrections
- Typo fixes
- Table formatting

## Version Discovery

A running RCAN implementation declares its spec version via:
- mDNS TXT record: `version=1.2.0`
- RCAN manifest: `rcan_version: "1.2.0"`
- Registry API: `api_version: "1.0"` (registry API versioned independently)
