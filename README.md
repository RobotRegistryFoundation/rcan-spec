<!-- BEGIN: ecosystem certification disclaimer (canonical, derived from spec §10) -->
> **Conformance is not certification.**
>
> Conformance to RCAN tracks (L1–L4 protocol, Gateway Authority, HIL Runtime Safety) is *self-asserted via signed bundles* and *independently replayable from those bundles*. Conformance is not certification. Certification requires audit by a qualified third-party body, which is intentionally out-of-scope for the foundation in 2026.

## Where this fits in the stack

This repo is the **wire-protocol specification** of a small, composable, Apache/MIT-licensed ecosystem. Each layer is independent — adopt one, or all seven.

| Layer | Piece | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **Declaration** | [ROBOT.md](https://github.com/RobotRegistryFoundation/robot-md) | The file a robot ships at its root. YAML frontmatter + markdown prose. Declares identity, capabilities, safety gates. Spec + Python CLI. |
| **Agent bridge** | [robot-md-mcp](https://github.com/RobotRegistryFoundation/robot-md-mcp) | MCP server that exposes a `ROBOT.md` to Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Zed, Gemini CLI — any MCP-aware agent. One `claude mcp add` away. |
| **Wire protocol** ← *this* | [RCAN](https://rcan.dev/spec/) | How robots, gateways, and planners talk. Signed envelopes, LoA enforcement, PQC crypto, EU AI Act §23–§27 compliance blocks. |
| **Python SDK** | [rcan-py](https://github.com/RobotRegistryFoundation/rcan-py) | `pip install rcan` — RCANMessage, RobotURI, ConfidenceGate, HiTLGate, AuditChain. |
| **TypeScript SDK** | [rcan-ts](https://github.com/RobotRegistryFoundation/rcan-ts) | `npm install rcan-ts` — same API surface for Node + browser. |
| **Registry** | [Robot Registry Foundation](https://robotregistryfoundation.org) | Permanent RRN identities. Public resolver at `/r/<rrn>`. Like ICANN for robots. |
| **Productized runtime (Layer 4)** | [OpenCastor](https://github.com/craigm26/OpenCastor) | Open-source productized RCAN runtime — connects LLM brains to hardware bodies. One implementation of RCAN. |

## What Problem RCAN Solves

Robots today are islands. A Boston Dynamics Spot and a Raspberry Pi rover can't talk to each other, authenticate each other, or safely hand off work to each other — even if they're in the same room. RCAN defines a common addressing scheme (Robot URIs), a message envelope with built-in safety fields, and a federation model so any manufacturer can run their own registry while still interoperating with every other robot on the network. Think of it as DNS + HTTPS, but for robotics.

## Key Concepts

**RRN (Robot Registration Number)** — a permanent, globally unique identifier assigned by the registry. Format: `RRN-000000000001` (root) or `RRN-BD-000000000001` (delegated namespace). Survives hardware swaps and OS reinstalls.

**Robot URI (RURI)** — a resolvable address that embeds the registry, manufacturer, model, version, and device ID: `rcan://registry.rcan.dev/acme/arm/v2/unit-001`.

**R2RAM (Robot-to-Robot Access Model)** — role-based access control for robot-to-robot commands. Five levels: Guest → Observer → User → Operator → Creator. Scopes are fine-grained (read, control, safety, admin).

**Protocol 66** — RCAN's mandatory safety layer. Core invariant: local safety always wins. ESTOP is never blocked. Cloud commands pass through the same confidence gates and bounds checks as local commands.

**Message Types** — 31 defined message types covering commands, telemetry, consent, audit, federation sync, and ESTOP. Every message carries a `msg_id` for replay prevention and a `confidence` field for AI accountability.

## Spec Sections

| Section | Title |
|---|---|
| §1 | Robot URI (RURI) — canonical address format and validation |
| §2 | Role-Based Access Control — 5-level hierarchy, fine-grained scopes |
| §3 | Message Format — common envelope, all 31 MessageType values |
| §4 | Discovery (mDNS) — `_rcan._tcp.local` for LAN-local robot discovery |
| §5 | Authentication — RCAN JWT structure, gateway tokens, verification order |
| §6 | Safety Invariants — local supremacy, graceful degradation, audit trail |
| §7 | Federation — Right to Redirect, Local Supremacy, cross-registry trust |
| §8 | Robot Config (RCAN File) — `.rcan.yaml` schema, required and optional blocks |
| §9 | Capabilities — standard capability names, required scopes, HTTP endpoints |
| §10 | Autonomous Navigation — dead-reckoning waypoint API, physics prereqs |
| §11 | Behavior Scripts — YAML behavior format, step types, Behavior API |
| §12 | Depth & Sensing — depth obstacle zone API, JET colormap, safety integration |
| §13 | Telemetry Streaming — WebSocket endpoint, push rate, required fields |
| §14 | Provider Management — quota fallback, offline fallback, health check |
| §15 | Swarm Coordination — node registry, broadcast commands, safety rules |
| §16 | AI Accountability — confidence gates, HiTL gates, Thought Log |
| §17 | Distributed Registry Node Protocol — node types, RRN namespaces, sync |
| §18 | Capability Advertisement Protocol — Capability Object Map schema |
| §19 | Behavior/Skill Invocation — INVOKE, INVOKE_RESULT, INVOKE_CANCEL |
| §20 | Telemetry Field Registry — joint telemetry schema, Prometheus labels |
| §21 | Robot Registry Integration — RRN↔RURI mapping, ownership proof |
| Appendix B | Conformance Levels L1–L4 |

## SDKs

| SDK | Language | Install | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| [rcan-py](https://github.com/RobotRegistryFoundation/rcan-py) | Python 3.10+ | `pip install rcan` | 754 |
| [rcan-ts](https://github.com/RobotRegistryFoundation/rcan-ts) | TypeScript / Node 18+ | `npm install rcan-ts` | 447 |
| [OpenCastor](https://github.com/craigm26/OpenCastor) | Python (robot runtime) | `pip install opencastor` | 6,459 |

## Companion formats

RCAN defines the *wire* layer (how robots talk). A robot still needs a way to declare *itself* — what it is, what it can do, and what safety envelope it operates under — to any agent that connects to it.

| Format | Purpose | Home |
|---|---|---|
| [**ROBOT.md**](https://robotmd.dev) | Single-file robot manifest (YAML frontmatter + markdown prose) — read by any agent harness (Claude Code, ChatGPT, Gemini, Ollama, …) at session start so the planner knows the robot before the first prompt. Uses `rcan_version` in the frontmatter to pin its RCAN target. | [RobotRegistryFoundation/robot-md](https://github.com/RobotRegistryFoundation/robot-md) |

ROBOT.md is independent of RCAN — you can ship one without the other — but the two compose cleanly: a robot with a ROBOT.md that pins `rcan_version` speaks the [RCAN protocol](https://rcan.dev/spec/) on the wire at the pinned version and declares that fact in its manifest.

## Conformance Badges

Implementations can declare a conformance level in their `/.well-known/rcan-node.json` manifest:

| Level | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **L1** | Robot URI parsing, basic message format |
| **L2** | L1 + authentication, RBAC, ESTOP |
| **L3** | L2 + replay prevention, audit chain, confidence gates |
| **L4** | L3 + registry integration, RRN, ownership proof |

Conformance tests live in the [`tests/`](tests/) directory and run against a reference implementation via `npm run test`.

## Spec Versioning

RCAN follows a **major.minor** policy. The spec is versioned independently of any SDK. Minor bumps add fields and message types; they never remove or rename existing ones — newer SDKs can read older messages.

For active spec/SDK pairings, see the [live compatibility matrix](https://rcan.dev/compatibility). Full version history at [rcan.dev/changelog](https://rcan.dev/changelog).

## Contributing to the Spec

The spec is an Astro static site deployed to [rcan.dev](https://rcan.dev/spec/).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # localhost:4321
npm run build    # production → dist/
npm run test     # conformance tests
```
