# RCAN MessageType Numbering Plan

> **Version**: v3.3.0 (draft) | **Updated**: 2026-10-15 | **Status**: Canonical

This document is the **single source of truth** for RCAN MessageType integer assignments.
Both `rcan-py` and `rcan-ts` SDKs **MUST** use these exact values.

## Numbering Rules

1. **Values are permanent.** Once assigned, a MessageType value MUST NOT be reassigned or reused.
2. **New types append.** New MessageTypes are assigned the next available integer.
3. **Gaps are allowed.** If a type is deprecated, its value is retired — not reclaimed.
4. **Cross-SDK consistency.** Both `rcan-py` and `rcan-ts` MUST use identical integer assignments.
5. **Protobuf compatibility.** Values correspond to the `MessageType` enum in `message_envelope.proto`.
